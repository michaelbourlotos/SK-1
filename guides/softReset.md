### sk-1 soft reset 

The soft reset are the lower two wires. Connect to a normaly open momentary switch.

The two upper wires are the pitchbend. Notice the coil has been removed hoping to achieve a deeper pitchbend down.

It's been a while ago , but I had the impression it worked. 

This battered board has seen several revisions. 

At the right you can see the TC74HC02 NAND gate. I experimented cutting a trace there, but resoldered later on.
